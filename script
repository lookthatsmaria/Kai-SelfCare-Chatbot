I feel defeated

Out of breath when I played in the park with my granddaughter

I have nothing to offer my family anymore.

My family has to look in on me more often than they used to.

I contribute to my family in new ways, such as offering advice and support.

Because of my COPD and because I am getting older, I have more physical limitations than I used to, 
and I do need my family’s help from time to time, but I am able to offer them many valuable things and contribute to my grandkids’ lives.
